# Project-1

Regional cities like Cairns and Townsville have small to medium sized businesses who struggle to fill technical roles. These roles can vary based on experience needed, hours to be worked and duration of the job. As the client has become well-known in the region many of these employers contact the client via email or phone, asking for recommendations of suitable students and/or alumni for these roles. 
IT@JCU would like to have a computerised process to:
a.	Allow employers to post job opportunities;
b.	Allow IT@JCU staff to recommend students; and
c.	Respond to employers with their CV and contact details.

An innovative digital workflow has been built to solve this problem. This workflow focuses on improving the communication process between three entities: employers, staff and students.
